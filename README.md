In recent years, modern technology has changed the way we interact with our homes. The term Smart Home is no longer a surprise,
but most solutions on the market nowadays have remote servers. Remote servers bring simplicity in the installation of a smart device,
but the user loses the independence of his own system. As an example,when the internet connection fails, a large percentage of smart homes
become unusable, not to mention the sometimes questionable ways corporations,especially of cheaper devices, handle user data. 

By designing and implementing their own smart system, the user achieves both independence of their system and some flexibility.
Every element of the home can be transformed into a smart one with a few simple adjustments, exactly to the user's liking. 

An example of this would be just a simple and smart control of, for example, a gas boiler. 
The user has temperature sensors scattered around the home, when the average temperature of all rooms drops below a certain temperature,
the boiler switches on and heats the home until the desired temperature is reached. With the help of multiple temperature sensors,
the smart home can regulate the heating of the rooms and therefore prevent over or under heating in certain areas. 

One of the main advantages of a smart home running on a local server is the security of user data. Since all smart home data is 
processed locally and there is no need for third parties, user data is virtually inaccessible until the smart home infrastructure is breached. However,
with proper home network security, this possibility is virtually unlikely. 

All the above mentioned aspects led me, in collaboration with Mr. Krajsa, to the design and subsequent implementation of a self-sufficient smart home, 
running on a Raspberry Pi platform with the open-source operating system HA (Home Assistant), using ESP32 modules and deRFmega128.
